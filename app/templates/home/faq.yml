- question: "What is Pear?"
  answer: "Pear is a cutting-edge AI platform that enables software engineers to create intelligent agents to automate various aspects of their work. With Pear, engineers can automate activities like code generation, debugging, code reviews, security audits, and even writing unit tests. These AI agents act like an extra pair of hands, taking care of routine and time-consuming tasks and freeing up engineers to focus on more complex and innovative aspects of software development. Through this approach, Pear not only enhances productivity but also reduces the likelihood of human error and enables more efficient delivery of high-quality software."
- question: "What does Pear do that GitHub Copilot Doesn’t?"
  answer: "While both Pear and GitHub Copilot are AI-powered tools designed to assist software developers, they specialize in different areas. GitHub Copilot is primarily designed for code suggestion and completion. It aids developers by predicting and generating lines or small blocks of code, greatly increasing immediate productivity and efficiency. Pear, however, extends beyond code generation. It excels at automating complex, multi-step tasks. With the ability to integrate data from various sources, like observability services, Pear can diagnose, debug, and even fix issues, essentially acting as an AI-powered assistant that can automate more advanced aspects of the software development process. Therefore, while GitHub Copilot provides line and function level suggestions, Pear can automate more complex, larger scale tasks."
- question: "As a founder or executive, why do I care about Pear why do I care about Pear?"
  answer: "As a founder or executive, particularly in tech startups, one of the main challenges is to achieve more with limited resources. Pear is a powerful tool that addresses this challenge by automating a significant portion of the time-consuming tasks in the software development process. This allows your engineering team to focus on more complex problem-solving and innovation, effectively maximizing their productivity. By streamlining the workflow and boosting efficiency, Pear can significantly contribute to your startup's growth, and potentially lead to considerable cost savings."
- question: "As a software engineer, why should I use Pear?"
  answer: "Pear is designed to take the monotonous and routine tasks off your plate, giving you more time to focus on complex problem-solving and innovation, areas that humans excel in and find rewarding. It helps streamline your workflow, increases your productivity, and could lead to a more satisfying work experience."
- question: "What LLM does Pear use?"
  answer: "Pear employs OpenAI’s advanced language models (gpt4 or gpt-3.5-turbo) in its API, harnessing the power of these models to perform a variety of tasks in the software development lifecycle."
- question: "Does Pear write perfect code?"
  answer: "No, Pear does not guarantee perfect code. It performs at the level of GPT-4, which means it's capable of generating useful and coherent code, but this output should always be reviewed and tested by humans before deployment in a production environment. Like any other tool, it’s meant to aid the process and not replace human judgment and expertise."
- question: "Will my code be shared with other users?"
  answer: "Absolutely not. Pear respects user privacy and confidentiality. Your code is not shared with any other users, nor is it used for training the AI models. It remains exclusively your property."
- question: "How are the transmitted prompts protected?"
  answer: "Pear takes data security seriously. All requests sent to Pear are made over HTTPS, a secure protocol that encrypts data in transit. Furthermore, any data that Pear stores is encrypted in its databases, which are secured and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals."
- question: "What can kind of assistance can Pear help me with?"
  answer: "Pear can assist with a wide array of tasks related to software development. This includes but is not limited to building new features, fixing bugs, reviewing pull requests, conducting security and compliance audits, and writing tests. Essentially, it is designed to handle the more routine tasks of software development, enabling you to focus on the more strategic aspects."
- question: "What are the limitations of Pear?"
  answer: "While Pear is a powerful AI tool, it does have limitations which are similar to the ones present in the GPT-4 model it uses. For example, it might not fully understand the context of complex tasks or be able to make decisions that require deep domain knowledge. Also, while it can generate code and automate some tasks, it can't replace the strategic thinking, creative problem solving, and judgement calls that a human engineer can make."
- question: "Do I need to be an engineer to use Pear?"
  answer: "Yes, Pear is primarily designed for use by software engineers. It's a tool that aids in various stages of the software development lifecycle, and understanding how to effectively use it requires knowledge of programming and software development processes. However, it can also be a valuable learning tool for those studying software engineering or looking to enhance their coding skills."
